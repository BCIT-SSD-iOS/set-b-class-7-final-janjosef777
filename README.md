## 1) Introduction

Given the duration and complexity of our lectures so far I have decided to give you some additional time for "hands-on" experience.
I give you the choice to either:
- Complete a passion project using the skills that you have learned in the previous 6 classes.
- Extend and enhance one of our existing apps with NEW functionality.
- Complete tutorial(s) related to new skills that you are interested in.

## 2) Pick Your Poison

My recommendation on how to make a decision:
1. If an idea for a passion project comes easily to you and your heart will be in it...I recommend you go this route.
2. If you cannot come up with something that you are passionate to build, but can see some potential in one of the apps that you have already built? Go for it!
3. If you are not really into iOS development or you can't envision a project that you can complete in time? Find an online tutorial (or two/three depending on the difficulty) that you can complete today. I will list some below.

## 4) Submission
Whichever you choose, the deadline for completion is **April 14th, 2019**.

Please ensure that you do not over extend yourself in these final weeks, and under no circumstances should this spill into your Industry Project Time.

If you choose multiple tutorials, ONLY submit completed projects. If you partial finish one please do not include it in your repo.

If you choose multiple tutorials, please create a seperate repo in the BCIT-SSD-iOS organization for each project. When you are complete overwrite the README.md in the Assignment repo with links to each of your repos.

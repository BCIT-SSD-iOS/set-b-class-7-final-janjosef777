# RoshanTimer


## Introduction

For Players of Dota 2, to keep track of Roshan's death and respawn.

>Respawning
>When Roshan is slain, he respawns after a **random time between 8â€“11 minutes**. Unlike with other neutral creeps, the respawn cannot be prevented by any means. The players do not get any indicator for when exactly he respawns, but spectators and casters can see a clock at Roshan's spawn point, showing the exact time left for the respawn (not until 5 minutes after Roshan was slain).

at the **00:03:00** mark, Roshan *may* be up. The miniRoshan at the middle of the screen turns to red to signify his presence.

To get started, press the **Start** Button.

To reset the timer, in case of an accidental start, tap the **Reset** button. An alert will pop up to confrim that you want to reset.
